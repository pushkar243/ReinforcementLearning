# ReinforcementLearning
In this repository I have uploaded a couple of examples of Reinforcement Learning :

1. Automated Trading Strategy using DDQN: Background: In finance, automated trading systems are used to execute trades in financial
markets based on predefined rules. These systems often employ quantitative strategies that rely
on analyzing market data to make trading decisions. However, designing effective trading
strategies manually can be challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial
markets.
Objective: The objective is to develop an automated trading system that can learn to buy, sell or
hold the stocks directly from historical market data

2. Spaceship problem using DQN : You are developing a mobile game where players control a spaceship navigating through an asteroid field. The objective is to avoid collisions with the asteroids for as long as possible. The game environment is represented as a 2D grid, where the spaceship can move up, down, left, or right. You can refer the picture for an idea.
